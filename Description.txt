Problem 1
Part a
Step 1 :- Implemented ordinary Push and Pop for a regular stack.
Step 2 :- Implemented constraints as given in the problem-
          (i)The number which user is inputting  should be greater then equal to 0 and less 	     then or equal to 9.
          (ii) Take input sequentially i.e. number which to be inputted should be just 	                   greater then the last input.
Part b
Step 1 :- Take sequence as an input from user and store it in an array.
Step 2 :- the next number in the sequence should be either greater or equal to the last Step 3 :- Numbers is Pushed in the Stack till equal to first number than it is popped and 	then check the  popped number. 


Problem 2
1. Take input from user of n and m.
2. Created an array(circle) of size m.Initialized values from 1 to n.
3. Created a temporary(temp) array.
4. loop if m>1
	(i) copy circle elements in temp array.
	(ii) reinitialize circle elements to 1st element as n+1,2nd element as n+2 and so 	     on.
	(iii) decrement m 
5. Print result.
